# Game Modes
## Easy
Fairly simple, the walls don't kill you, you move painfully slow, and the only way you can die is by running into yourself.

## Medium
Deceptively simple, your snake moves slightly faster that it does in easy mode, but now the walls kill you if you run into them head-first.

## Hard
In hard, your snake moves even faster, and now there are rocks randomly placed on-screen that kill you if you run into them. The walls do not kill you, that would make this mode infuriatingly difficult.

## Extreme
Somewhat of a misnomer, a more apt title for this mode would be "***Wack***," but ya know, extreme sounds cooler. When you first start, you'll probably be like "wow this guy is stupid, the walls don't kill you, there's no rocks... what is he thinking calling this extreme???" Alright alright shut up. Just try warping through a wall and you'll see. Oh and your speed is 1.5x what it is on hard.
